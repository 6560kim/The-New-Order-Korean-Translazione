 THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "A new order has descended upon the world. With the triumph of the Axis Powers in the Second World War, the world has been forever changed. Yesterday's great empires are now dust under the boot of today's victors. A German lands on the moon as Hitler fades. In America, the old system lies shattered. The Mediterranean's power balance lies on a knife's edge. China, little more then a slave of Japan, begins to transform itself. And in Russia, long-damned warlords realize their destiny."

 USA_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "While America joined the Second World War, it was too late. The United States performed admirably, humbling the Kriegsmarine in the Atlantic and beginning to turn the tide in the Pacific, but the invention of the atom bomb ended any hopes of American victory for those few remaining Allies.\n\nNow, twenty years later, America stands divided. While the depression is slowly ending, the American political scene sits in chaos. The government remains locked between the uneasy Republican-Democrats and the National Progressive Party, a failing union of America's political outcasts. With the Civil Rights movement greatly shifting the political sphere, the 60's will herald the greatest threats America has ever faced."
 CAN_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "In the wake of the fall of Britain the Canadians turned their heads to their southern neighbors for leadership and guidance, even as the Royal Family settled in Ottawa. Rising from the shadows of George Drew's conservative political machine, Lester Pearson and his Liberal Party have risen through snap elections to stand at the helm of a nation struggling to define itself. Constitutional monarchy or a free republic? British, French, Quebecois, or all of the above, or none? Is the nation forever doomed to be an appendage of US foreign policy? What can be done about the increasingly virulent separatism afflicting Quebec? In the uncertainty, one thing is certain: Canada must stand together, both within and without, or the land that stretches from sea to sea will quickly find itself becalmed by currents it cannot withstand."
 CUB_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Socialism and freedom from foreign domination. These were the values Fidel Castro fought for against the government of Fulgencio Batista- at least until he received an offer from the CIA. In exchange for covert support in overthrowing the worryingly pro-German Batista, Castro would refrain from advocating revolution or anti-Americanism in the Western Hemisphere and allow American corporate investment into Cuba. Although it angered communist hardliners, the deal allowed Castro's socialist revolutionaries to sweep into power. But as hardliners plot to expel the CIA's influence from Cuba, and as opposition builds in the States to this bastion of communism so close to American shores, who knows how long this will last?"
 ICE_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "It's become something of a joke, that Iceland is as free a nation as Greenland is green.\n\nWhile ostensibly independent, the presence of the United States military is felt everywhere. Bases dot the island and nearly as many of its inhabitants live in a military base as outside of them. While at first the arrival of American troops was seen as a positive mark, a sure sign of the nation's continued freedom against German rule in Europe, this has quickly turned against the Americans. Now seeing as occupiers and with unrest growing, the US holds onto the island ever harder, fearing a soft German coup in the northern Atlantic."
 AST_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Australia- a continent, an island, and a country, located on the edge of the world. Sitting just below Japan's Co-Prosperity Sphere, it either narrowly avoided or repelled invasion in the Second World War, depending on who you ask. In the years after, Australian society, encouraged by their American allies, became more and more militarized to ward off the looming Japanese threat, even as the Sphere pulled back towards defending what it had already gained. Postwar Australian politics came to be dominated by two political blocs- the conservative coalition between the United Australia Party and Australian Country Party, and the Australian Labour Party. The two would spar on issues from Australia's military involvement to the controversial White Australia Policy, and as further conflicts flare up around the globe, who will come out on top?"
 NZL_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "New Zealand is a small island nation on the periphery of the world, often forgotten among the superpower politics of Washington and Tokyo. However, for New Zealanders, superpower politics could not be closer to home. Thousands of New Zealanders fought the Japanese in the Second World War, many of them perishing in the process. After the war ended, its scars remained, with New Zealand facing demographic damage, lost trade partners, economic crisis, and an increasingly pushy America using the nation's islands as bases for its military transport to Australia. Although the conservative National Party has managed to steer the ship of state thus far, for how long will they be able to maintain their strength?"
 SAF_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "군주 없는 군주국이며 방향성도 없는 남아프리카 연방은 나라를 산산조각낼 수 있는 불안을 억누르기가 점점 더 어려워진 상황에 처했습니다.\n\n보어인이 권력을 차지한 적은 없지만, 그들의 존재감은 그들이 대표나 혹은 노골적으로 독립을 주장함에 따라 더 크게 느껴지고 있습니다. 다른 곳에서는, 아프리카인들이 법으로 정해지지는 않았지만 실질적으로 차별이 만연한 국가에 대항해 대대적인 시위를 벌이고 있습니다. 거기에 국내 문제도 모자라 남아프리카는 두 세력의 영역 사이에서 분열되기까지 하였습니다. 미국은 끊임없이 OFN에 가입하라는 압력을 가하고, 독일은 제국에 굴복할 것을 강요하고 있습니다."
 GUY_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "As German panzers rolled along Downing Street, British Guiana suddenly found itself free of Imperial influence, and from the ashes of the war, the Republic of Guyana was born. Not all is fine in the Republic, however. Hers is a story told far too often throughout history; a feeble nation used and shackled down to suffer. Their own beloved President, Cheddi Jagan, was voted out and exiled by a CIA-rigged election in the 50's.\n\nGuyana's new president inspires not hope, but fear. Forbes Burnham an iron-fisted strongman, and under his leadership, the liberties of Guyanans grow weaker with each passing day. Strict racial segregation laws have been introduced, restricting the rights of Indo-Guyanans. Will Burnham continue to strike down his opponents? Or will Guyana break her chains and be freed?"

 BRT_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Brittany owes much to the hun.\n\nWhile the nation claims to be a proud member of the Unity-Pakt, in reality Brittany is the greatest thorn in the alliance's side. The largest black market in Europe, some have called Brittany the 'syndicate with a state'. Seeing the amassing of wealth and the weakening of the Pakt as its best chance to ensure domestic stability and keep itself protected, Brittany's only interest in the Pakt is how long it can use it to stave off the looming threat of Burgundy. There are those, however, scorned old friends of President Mordrel, who believe new direction is necessary on the peninsula."
 MAD_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Madagaskar is falling down.\n\nThe garrison seems to be increasingly paranoid and ever crueler in its attempts to prove itself as true children of Germany despite their blood and pasts. The Jewish, a leftover from a time when Germany hoped it could simply remove its untermensch by shipping them overseas, have increasingly begun calling the nation their 'Israel' and the insurgency has proven both bloody and nearly impossible for the garrison to contain. When these two groups are not causing trouble, the rising tides of African nationalism has also brought the natives up in arms. While this all threatens to tear the nation apart, Reichskommissar Maurice sits in his office, quietly committing treason."
 GGN_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 ""Germanization is at an all time high! Dissent is at an all time low! Poland is pacified, hell, it mind as well be named Southern Prussia!"\n\nThis sentence was the first in one of the many reports Hans Frank has sent to the Reichstag, as he has done dutifully for over a decade. On paper, his rule is the strongest and most impressively done in the Reich, having followed Nazi policy to a T and done so with the finesse and ability of the greatest of politicians. In reality, Poland is a collapsing mess, and in shadows and sewer tunnels, the resistance waits for the German grip to slip..."
 OST_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The crown jewel in the Nazi crown, Ostland is seen as the model colony for all German administrators to follow.\n\nGermanization in Ostland is the highest in the Reich, its industrial and rural production is reaching all time highs, and Reichskommissar Lohse has taken the first steps towards signing a permanent ceasefire with several of the largest partisan groups in the nation.\n\nOf course, as Lohse ails and the homeland falls, one must wonder what will happen to the colony that has so closely modeled itself after its master..."
 MCW_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Kasche sits on a throne of failure. Oddly enough, this has given him great success, just not in the eyes of the Reich.\n\nOnce a staunch proponent of hardline Nazism, his near death at the hands of partisans during the West Russian War has left him as a shell. Now he merely presides over Moskowien with the lightest of hands, hoping to merely prevent more bloodshed from consuming the colony and possibly reaching himself. Every report he sends to Germany, brutally honest with how little progress Germanization has had, is another step towards the firing line. But as the Reich seems to be crumbling, Kasche has already prepared for the inevitabilities. Still, one must wonder what will happen without the colony's apathetic leadership..."
 ENG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Although American aid came to the English in the World War, it was too late, and for the first time, England was invaded by a foreign power. Her empire stripped away, and with an occupation force ensuring 'good order and civility' of the English people, England now faces its darkest hour, with no Arthur to save it. If anything can be said of the British however, it is that they are hard headed, and even now, twenty years later, whispers of rebellion spread.\n\nThe nation now sits on a tipping point, collaborate with the wicked Hun, or risk everything to stop them?"
 BRG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Much of northern France remained under direct German occupation when the Second World War ended. Life there was cruel and oppressive, but eventually settled into something resembling normalcy. But it would not last. After his failed coup during the West Russian War, Heinrich Himmler was given northern France and Belgium as his fiefdom by Hitler, hoping it would leave him content to no longer meddle in German politics. But what was meant to be a sinecure became a staging ground. The land of the nascent SS-Ordensstaat Burgund is clay in Himmler's hands, free for him to mold as he sees fit. And with his plans growing more audacious and destructive by the day, the \"Shadow State\" will soon play host to greater and greater dangers to the Reich, Europe, and eventually the world."
 GER_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Once humbled by their failures in the Weltkrieg, Germany once more rose to prominence with the leadership of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s. Thanks to the failures of the Allies, WW2 has ended in complete German victory.\n\nGermany now presides over the most powerful Empire on Earth, but despite her victory, Germany's control remains tenuous at best. Wracked by an economic crash that has frozen the nation for a decade, and with a massive slave caste providing for the German people, the population has began to protest. The nation is now trapped in a series of student protests and the machinations of the Reichsbank."
 CZE_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Bohemia should have been part of the Reich by now, but not all things are meant to be.\n\nWhile the protectorate was well on its way towards integration in the 50s, the rapid deterioration of the Reich's power soon put all of these plans on hold.\n\nDespite this, Bohemia ran as normal, before oddly enough the resistance seemed to reappear. Once small cells apparently doubled and tripled in size almost overnight, and the garrison now struggles to hold the line. One can only wonder who would possibly raise so much trouble behind the shadows."
 CRN_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The brave sons of Germany watch eternal. Their charge? All of England for the security of the Fatherland. Only the finest soldiers can find posting in the Cornwall Governorate, the center of operations for the entirety of the garrison of occupied England. Having been proven right in Halder's insistence that the English would never peacefully aid in Germany's unification of Europe after their unsuccessful rebellion in the 50s, the garrison now stands on the alert at all times, prepared to do battle for the prosperity of the Pakt.\n\nWords muttered under quiet breaths speak of Germany facing its twilight, and if such a time would come, the Garrison must be ready to do whatever it must do for the homeland. The isles will be secure!"
 ANG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "남서아프리카 국가판무관부의 조종사들은 아프리카가 혼란 속에 갇혀 있음에도 창공을 지배하고 있습니다. 앙골라에서 출발한 수백 대의 독일 폭격기가 서아프리카를 폭격해 잿더미로 만들고 있습니다. 국가판무관 솅크가 그의 비행대 본부에서 남서아프리카를 통치하고 있습니다. 원주민들을 가볍게 대하고 그의 임무는 훨씬 더 가볍게 대하는 그는 국가를 실질적으로 통치하기를 꺼려하는 것처럼 보이는 것과 직무유기로 많은 비판을 받고 있습니다.\n\n하지만 솅크에게는 오직 드넓은 창공만이 그가 창조한 지옥으로부터 위안을 줄 수 있는 것뿐입니다. 몇몇 사람들은 이 국가판무관이 전적으로 제국에 충성하는 것은 아니라고 속삭이고 있습니다. 하지만 모든 보고서에서는 솅크는 지금까지 그래왔던 것처럼 독일 공군의 모범적인 영웅답게 제국에 충성심을 유지하고 있습니다."
 MZB_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "어떤 사람들은 국가판무관부는 그 통치자의 거울과 같다고 말합니다. 참으로 동아프리카는 한스 휘티히와 매우 닮았습니다. 둘 모두 무미건조하고, 무자비하며, 인간성이라고는 눈 뜨고 찾아봐도 없습니다. \n아리아인 주인들의 감시 아래에서, '열등 인종'의 노역, 그들의 피, 그들의 눈물과 죽음은 단지 제국의 완벽한 연료에 불과합니다. 하지만 심지어 그 아리아인 주인들조차 삼엄한 감시를 받고 있습니다. 휘티히는 무능과 연민을 경멸하고, 언제든지 그와 같은 결함이 있는 사람은 누구든지 짓밟을 것입니다. 그의 적을 기다리고 있는 것은 죽음조차도 사치인 평생의 고통입니다. \n타락과 반역의 세계에서, 한스 휘티히는 승산이 있건 없건, 수단과 방법을 가리지 않고 그 대가에 상관없이 아리아인의 모범을 지킬 것입니다."
 COG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "무성한 정글에 덮여 있고 모든 사냥꾼들을 기쁨에 겨워 울게 할 야생동물로 가득 찬, 과거에 벨기에령 콩고였던 중앙아프리카 국가판무관부는 독일의 모든 식민지 중에서 가장 부자입니다. 하지만 이런 완벽한 표면 아래에는 그 어떤 사파리 사냥보다 훨씬 더 위험한 세계의 이면이 있습니다.\n국가판무관 지크프리트 뮐러는 행정 업무를 등한시하고 사냥을 즐기며 나날을 보내고, 식민지 전체는 중앙아프리카의 자원을 원하는 독일과 외국의 많은 기업들을 위한 개인 사업장으로 변모했습니다.\n하지만, 노련한 사냥꾼임에도 불구하고 뮐러는 훨씬 더 큰 포식자들의 먹잇감이 된 자신을 발견할지도 모릅니다. 밀림에는 위험이 도사리고 있고, 때때로 잉크와 종이는 송곳니보다 더 많은 살육과 고통을 불러올 수 있습니다."
 CAU_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Reichskommissariat Kaukasien was originally meant to be a \"model colony\" of sorts, one where the natives would live peacefully under the Reich's watchful eye. The natives, of course, had different ideas. When the West Russian War broke out, the \"Transcaucasian Soviet\" launched a mass rebellion, besieging the capital of Tiflis and almost linking up with the Red Army. They were defeated, but it was clear that a firmer hand was needed. Enter Josias, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont. He was renowned for his methodical efficiency, but after being captured and tortured by Transcaucasian partisans, he also became known for his methodical extermination of rebels. The Reich doesn't bother him as long as the oil flows, but they fail to notice that his loyalties may lie elsewhere..."

 JAP_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The sun never sets on the Japanese Empire, or at least it hasn't yet. Reigning over the single largest population of any nation on Earth, the Japanese maintain the largest military, industrial base, and navy in the world. With treaty ports in America and ownership of the Pacific, Japan has gone from a shut in nation behind the Europeans to the masters of the sea and land. All is not well, however, as the increasingly byzantine Imperial Court constantly undermines the monarchy, and the more Japan uses China's resources, the more their grip on the colonies slip."

 IBR_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "With Germany victorious in the Second World War, many expected Spain to rise alongside it. When Spain refused to bend to the will of Germany however tensions soon began to rise. The Germans finally demanded they bend to their demands to build the Dam of Gibraltar, which the Spanish finally relented to.\n\nThis led to chaos however as the Atlantropa plan failed, and as Germany confiscated Portugal's Africa colonies and began sabre rattling against their southern neighbors, Portugal and Spain agreed to unification to better hold off German invasion. This invasion never came however, and now the two rest uneasily with one another. As German might fades into the past, so too does this uncomfortable union..."

 OMS_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Conceived by Dmitry Karbyshev, an old Red general who went through years of pain and hatred by the hands of Nazi invaders, the Black League of Omsk was originally a secret military society within the Red Army ranks that sought to overturn the incompetent Communist leadership and commit the whole Russian people to the total destruction of the loathed Germans, whatever the cost.\n\nFollowing the failed coup against the Soviet government in Tyumen and the retreat to Omsk, the Black League has become entrenched in its extremist vision and seeks nothing but to bring the harsh vengeance upon all enemies of Russia and ensure that the Motherland will never be threatened again."

 WRS_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "As the Soviet Union burned, its loyal Red Army refused to yield. Marshal Kliment Voroshilov, setting himself up to work, was able to rebuild the Red Army, uniting it into the West Russian Revolutionary Front. Striking at the occupiers, the Front was at the cusp of victory when they were driven back at the last minute, nearly shattering it for good.\n\nYet the Front lived on. From the city of Arkhangelsk, its grizzled veterans stand at the ready, preparing for the time when they rebuild the Motherland and drive the fascists from her borders. However, Voroshilov is not a young man, and his final hour draws close every day. That will be the moment, that his torch will finally be passed on to his generals, and they shall be the one who leads the Front to victory..."

 SAM_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Born of hazy post-war plans, the Russian Liberation Army, or ROA, was envisioned as nothing more than a collaborator militia writ large. Led by General Vlasov and a collection of turncoat Red Army officers, the ROA was meant to help legitimize German control of RK Moskowien until the Russians could be driven further east or exterminated.\n\nThe West Russian War in the fifties changed all of this. Expanded by the desperate Germans and deployed to delay the resurgent Red Army, the ROA thrived against all odds and soon found itself pushing east. By the war's end, Vlasov and his men controlled a power base beyond the Reich's grasp. Written off as mutinous rabble, the ROA has spent the intervening years waiting. Some hope for redemption; the others merely await the opportunity to carve an empire in Western Russia and beyond."

 BRY_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Yagoda and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in Irkutsk seem to have learned nothing from the fall of Bukharin's Union. They insist they are the true heirs to Lenin's revolution while the NKVD snuffs out all intra-party criticism. Worse yet, they stifle the local Buryat people's autonomy under a Russo-centric hegemony. After years of Yagoda's tyranny, the various dissidents within his fiefdom have risen up to overthrow him and his Presidium.\n\nThey have rallied around the charismatic young idealist Valery Sablin, a passionate Leninist who has called for true freedom and equality for all the peoples of Russia. Everyone from Bukharinites distressed by growing NKVD control, Buryats who desire autonomy, junior officers and women who seek equality have joined his mutiny. But when Sablin wins - if he wins - he will have to come face to face with pragmatic challenges of governing a state. Will Sablin's Union live up to Lenin's ideals? Or will it backslide into Bukharinist dictatorial pragmatism?"

 IRK_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The Bukharin regime fractured and collapsed when it faced the Nazi onslaught. When Bukharin himself disappeared amidst the chaos, NKVD Director Genrikh Yagoda mobilized his surviving NKVD divisions to evacuate the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet as Eastward as he could. From there, the remains of the Bukharin government attempted to retain control over the Far East, but their grip slowly began to crumble as warlords and bandits rose up to take the land for themselves. Yagoda quickly lost confidence in the Party leadership; he and his NKVD began to take over various State functions, much to the chagrin of the Presidium.\n\nThe legitimate heirs to the Soviet Union are now in a precarious position. The balance of power in the Union is teetering between Yagoda loyalists in the State and the apparatchiks of the Party bureaucracy. As if that isn't enough, a former Soviet commander, Valery Sablin, has risen up against the Irkutsk government across Lake Baikal. Yagoda will have to quash this uprising swiftly if he hopes to one day reclaim the Union."

 KIR_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "As the West Russian Revolutionary Front surged toward Moskowien the Germans were desperate for something, anything that could halt the reborn Red Army's advance. They turned to one man, Vladimir Romanov, rightful heir to the Russian Empire, who had dreamed for years of retaking his shattered homeland. Grand Duke Vladimir was allowed to assemble a division of Russian exiles that the Germans planned to use as little more than cannon fodder. When the counteroffensive against the Revolutionary Front began, the Nazi generals were astonished to see the monarchist division fought harder and more aggressively than the Germans. As the Revolutionary Front began to collapse back into anarchy the German offensive came to a halt, but Vladimir pushed on, driving deep into Russia. He would not abandon his motherland.\n\nEventually the heir and his supporters seized the area around the city of Vyatka. There they established a pocket of monarchist rule in Russia and prepared to retake the rest of the empire. Since returning to Russia, the new emperor has ruled as a reluctant autocrat, knowing that it will take a strong hand to reunite Russia but hoping that his subjects will eventually have a voice in their government. The principality of Vyatka faces many troubles, from bickering generals and battling political cliques to questions of the Tsar's role in his government. The time is coming when these questions will be answered, and the fate of the Romanovs will be decided once and for all."

 PRM_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Alexey Dobrovolsky was once just like any other Slav, weak and cowardly, blindly following the orders of his superiors in the West Russian Revolutionary Front. It was not until he was sent to die in battle against the Germans that he saw what true strength looked like. He saw mighty Aryan warriors smashing the weak Russians who dared oppose them, demonstrating the superiority of the master race. While the West Russian Revolutionary Front collapsed around him, Alexey had an epiphany: Aryanism is not physical. It is psychological, and those who are worthy of becoming ubermensch can ascend to join the master race by casting aside their old, inferior cultures. Alexey Dobrovolsky died that day. Gutrum Vagner and the Aryan Brotherhood were born.\n\nMen fleeing from the Red Army flocked to join the brotherhood, drawn by its promises of enlightenment and a new dawn for a stronger Russia. Eventually Vagner's followers grew into the thousands, and the Fyurer declared it was time for the master race to conquer the east once and for all. The Brotherhood stormed into Perm, capturing the city and declaring the birth of a new Reykh. Since then they have expanded to the south and west, enslaving thousands of subhumans and uplifting anyone they find that is worthy of joining the ranks of the ubermensch. The Fyurer is not content with mindless raiding and pillaging, as fun as it is. He has far greater plans for the Brotherhood, plans that will be set in motion soon."

 AMR_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "As the Soviet Union rose to power thousands upon thousands of Russians fled to wherever they could. For many in the east that was the city of Harbin in Manchuria. Bitter over their defeat in the civil war and looking for any chance at redemption or revenge, these exiles turned to the new fascist movement that was just getting off its feet in Europe. Many of the Russians in Harbin embraced Fascism as the new rival to Communism, none more than Konstantin Rodzaevsky. The young man was a fiery orator and an open supporter of Hitler's ideology of National Socialism, and he quickly ascended the ranks to become the leader of the Russian Fascist party in Harbin.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed the exiles, seeing an opportunity to retake their homeland, were quick to strike. With support from Japan, Rodzaevsky led an invasion of the Russian far east, declaring his intent to reunite the nation and create a new era of Russian national socialism. All seemed to be going well, but Rodzaevsky was betrayed by two competing cliques. The white army officers had always hesitated to embrace fascism, and when they saw the opportunity to break away they took it, pledging their allegiance to a false Czar in Chita. In Magadan, Mikhail Matkovsky, long a challenger to Rodzaevsky's control of the RFP, declared Rodzaevsky was nothing more than a puppet of the genocidal nazis, and a traitor to the Russian nation. Now Rodzaevsky is left ruling a rump state, biding his time until he can retake what is rightfully his and teach the traitors a lesson they won't forget."

 MAG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Since the birth of the Russian Fascist Party Mikhail Matkovsky competed with Konstantin Rodzaevsky for control. Rodzaevsky was aggressive and idealistic, and openly supported Hitler's nazism, while Matkovsky was more subtle and diplomatic, and saw the racial hatred the Nazis held for Russians plainly. The two men often butted heads but worked together for the dream of a Russia free of Bolshevism. When the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union that dream suddenly became a reality, as the RFP organized an invasion of the Russian far east. However, Rodzaevsky's refusal to denounce national socialism even as the nazis carried out a genocide against the Russian people was the breaking point for Matkovsky. He knew that Germany would never tolerate a strong Russia, even a fascist one, and Rodzaevsky was only leading the nation towards suicide.\n\nMatkovsky and his supporters took control over the port of Magadan and declared that Rodzaevsky was a traitor to the motherland, and only Matkovsky would be able to reunite Russia under true fascism. Matkovsky's clique has now spent years preparing to strike south and finish Rodzaevsky once and for all. Resources in Magadan are scarce, forcing Matkovsky to turn to unusual sources of help. Mercenaries from all over the world have come to Magadan seeking fame and fortune, but the greatest source of support lies across the Pacific: the United States. Persuading the Americans will be no easy task, but if anyone can do it, it is Matkovsky."

 WCH_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "For many of the Russian exiles in Harbin, the rise of the Russian Fascist Party was a godsend. For the officers of the White Army in the city it was a nuisance. They had spent years fighting to restore the Romanov dynasty to their rightful throne, only to see the exile community abandon the monarchy for this distasteful new ideology. The old generals, led by Ataman Semyonov, reluctantly agreed to work with Rodzaevsky and the RFP more out of mutual hatred for the Bolsheviks than anything else. When the nazis invaded the Soviet Union and it became clear Hitler was not waging war against communism, but against the Russian people, the generals were appalled by Rodzaevsky's refusal to denounce nazism. It was decided that the partnership could not last, but the generals would wait to split until the time was right.\n\nThat time came shortly after Rodzaevsky launched his invasion of the Russian far east. The white officers invited Prince Michael Romanov to a dinner party in Harbin. Once there they involved him in all of their schemes, declaring that they would crown him as the new Czar and retake his empire. Both Prince Michael's reluctance to join their cause and ineligibility for the throne failed to dissuade them. Soon Semyonov's clique had seized the city of Chita, denounced the RFP and declared their loyalty to the newly crowned Czar. Free of Rodzaevsky's control and back on Russian soil, the officers are now preparing to destroy the fascist remnants and reunite Russia in the name of Czar Mikhail II, whether he wants it or not."

 ISH_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Russia was a land of battling cliques long before the Soviet Union fell to the Germans. In the chaotic days after Lenin's death multiple successors vied for control over the young Union. For a brief moment it appeared as though the crown might pass to Joseph Stalin, but tragedy struck. Stalin met with a mysterious and untimely demise, and his supporters were scattered across the Union, relegated to positions of no importance as Bukharin secured control. One of those men sent to Siberia was Lazar Kaganovich, and he never forgot the teachings of his mentor. When the Union collapsed under the weight of the German invasion Kaganovich was quick to act. Securing the support of Field Marshal Rokossovsky and Lieutenant-General Karbyshev, he took control of a massive stretch of territory from the Urals to Omsk. Kaganovich proclaimed the West Siberian People's Republic and prepared to retake the Union.\n\nIt was not meant to be. Both of his allies soon distanced themselves from Kaganovich, eventually breaking away entirely. Rokossovsky seized Sverdlovsk and the Republic's northern territories, While Karbyshev's Black League took the city of Omsk and its surroundings. Now Kaganovich is left ruling a fraction of his former territory from the city of Tyumen. Most men in his situation would have given up, but Kaganovich is made of stronger stuff. Soon his armies will march north and south, annihilating the traitors and reclaiming the Republic. Kaganovich is determined to reunite the Soviet union and avenge himself and his old mentor, the original man of steel."

 TOB_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky and his 3rd Army defended the Soviet Union from the fascist invader until there was no longer a union to defend. Bloodied but not defeated, Rokossovsky withdrew eastward, where he found himself part of the West Siberian People's Republic. However, seeing the corruption, incompetence, and callousness of the Republic's leadership, Rokossovsky quickly became disillusioned, and when the opportunity arose, he broke away and declared a rival military government in Sverdlovsk, seizing much of the Republic's northern territories along with it.\n\nNow, Sverdlovsk stands alone against the approaching storm, the bearer of the shining light of liberty in a land of oppression and death. Rokossovsky, as old as he is, remains steadfast in his desire to reunite the Motherland with the military at the helm, serving the worker and peasant above the bureaucrat, aristocrat, or apparatchik."

 KEM_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The story of the Principality of Kemerovo is the story of one man. Nikolay Krylov served as the Chief of Staff of the 62nd Army during the Great Patriotic War, leading it through some of the largest battles on the eastern front. No matter what Nikolay tried, every major engagement his army took part in ended in disaster. By the time the Union collapsed, the 62nd army had already fallen apart. Krylov and his clique of officers fled east, eventually finding themselves in the newly founded Central Siberian Republic. There he was charged with defeating the Siberian Black Army, who dealt him yet another humiliation on the battlefield. The last straw was when one of his closest lieutenants betrayed him and seized the city of Krasnoyarsk. Unable to cope, Krylov's psyche shattered.\n\nWhen his subordinates next saw their general, he was a changed man. He announced that he had experienced a revelation. He was the heir of Rurik, first Czar of the Rus, and it was his destiny to reunite Russia. The newly crowned Rurik II quickly drew significant attention as men flocked to his banner, drawn by promises of loot and his unusual ideology. Rurik II is not like the monarchs of old. He has promised to be a Czar of the Soviets, defending the proletarian revolution as the king of the workers and peasants. He has denounced Christianity and condemned the Romanov dynasty as traitors to the Russian people. No one knows what a Russia reunited by Rurik would look like, least of all himself, but as the Czar prepares for war the world may soon find out."

 ERS_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Even as the USSR burned around them, a collection of idealist Scholars, Artists, Poets, Scientists, and Authors came together in a noble attempt to rise from the ashes. This experiment quickly spread through Central Siberia, and, over time, came to be what is now known as the Central Siberian Republic. Using an unorthodox rotating constitution, rewritten after each election by the ruling party, the Republic was seen by many as a bastion of democratic thought and a revival of the democratic ideals of 1917.\n\nIn the end, ironically, it was the Bolsheviks once more that brought the Founders' dreams of democracy crashing down. Facing invasion from the east, several of the CSR's constituent cities revolted, and now the former bastion of liberty in Russia is ruled by despotic juntas, rampaging anarchists, and repressive bolsheviks. But not all hope is lost - the CSR's government, located in the city of Tomsk under a provisional government led by Boris Pasternak, has survived, and as the year 1962 dawns, the President prepares to restore full democracy to the Republic.\n\nCome then, Maestro, choose your instrument, and let the Symphony that is the Russian People play."

 KHA_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The Siberia Black Army rose in the bleak days of the Siberian War. As the Central Siberian Republic's authority withered and decayed, the Black Army was created by men like Lev Krasnopevtsev and Ivan Stepanov, formed from soviet defectors, simple peasants and rogue army officers. The newly formed army managed to repeal the Republic and take the area surrounding the city of Khakassia. Forming a 'state' based around the principles of militarized anarchism. Inspired by men such as Nestor Makhno, the Siberian Black Army is a society dedicated to freedom and self defense, the army itself asserting little authority beyond what is needed for self defense and membership is a choice, the people are largely free to do as they please. Even still the Black Army's influence grows more with each passing season and many worry it may soon dominate the communes, creating a military dictatorship in all but name."

From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
