 ### Ideas ###
 GER_SGR_criminal_soldiers:0 "'The Undesirables'"
 GER_SGR_criminal_soldiers_desc:0 "Corruption, racial theory, and outright insanity have led to many within the Reich being branded degenerates, criminals and enemies of the state. Now, in the chaos of the civil war, we will offer some of those most betrayed by the old regime a chance to build a new future where no German need live in fear of the state. Of course giving them the chance to fight against those who imprisoned them is just a bonus."
 GER_SGR_free_slave_recruits:0 "Freed Slave Recruits"
 GER_SGR_free_slave_recruits_desc:0 "We may lack in the experienced military divisions that our enemies were able to recruit to their causes, but that does not mean we will be outnumbered. Slaves are flooding into our territory, often at great personal risk, to fight for the man who has called for their freedom. These men and women may not be the best fighters the Reich has to offer, but none have a stronger passion to win this war."

 GER_SGR_return_to_kiev_desc:0 "Liberated from the Bolsheviks during the war, the Ukrainian region has become a vital part of the Reich over the past two decades. The regions fertile soil has attracted an entire generation of German settlers to farm its fields, whilst also acting as vital for projecting our naval power into the Black Sea and Mediterranean. Since the Civil War Ukraine has strayed far from the Reich, a situation we must quickly rectify."
 GER_SGR_offer_the_olive_branch_ukr:0 "Offer The Olive Branch"
 GER_SGR_offer_the_olive_branch_ukr_desc:0 "Reichskommissariat Ukraine is not an enemy of the Reich, merely a lost child left directionless when abandoned by its parent. But the Civil War is over, we now stand ready to bring our children back under our wing and guide them into the future once more. Despite some objections from the Wehrmacht, we shall go forth and send a delegation to Ukraine to extent the invitation to return home. For their sake, let us hope they accept."
 GER_SGR_back_into_the_reich:0 "Back Into The Reich"
 GER_SGR_back_into_the_reich_desc:0 "The leadership in Ukraine has agreed to return to the Reich, and of course we are most happy to have them back with us. The most sensible option for securing the region and ensuring that not only our interests, but those of the German colonists, are ensured is to continue with the policy of having Ukraine exist as a Reichskommissariat. History has shown the Ukrainians are simply not ready for self-rule, we must protect them from themselves."
 GER_SGR_a_new_reichkommissar:0 "A New Reichkommissar"
 GER_SGR_a_new_reichkommissar_desc:0 "Erich Koch has served Germany well in the past, but he is an ademant member of the Old Guard and has ruled Reichskommissariat Ukraine with one of the most brutal iron fists in the entire Reich. Combined with his strong connections to the militarists in Germany, we must consider carefuly whether the time has come to replace Koch with someone more amenable to the policies of the Führer."
 GER_SGR_purge_the_ss_ukr:0 "Purge The SS"
 GER_SGR_purge_the_ss_ukr_desc:0 "The SS may have been driven out of Germany, but Reichskommissariat Ukraine is still plagued with SS units deployed before the Civil War who no doubt intend to put the desires of their Burgundian masters above the interests of Germany. Now that Ukraine has returned to the fold, we must purge the region of the traitorous SS once and for all."
 GER_SGR_renegotiated_terms:0 "Renegotiated Terms"
 GER_SGR_renegotiated_terms_desc:0 "Under the previous regime, the agreements between Germania and Kiev regarding sending resources back to Germany, particularly grain, has been aggressively exploitative. The result has been economic and social disaster for the region, the root of numerous attempted uprisings and insurgencies. If we have a hope of keeping Reichskommissariat Ukraine stable, we must revisit these agreements and enforce new, less damaging terms."
 GER_SGR_mixed_military_ukr:0 "Mixed Military"
 GER_SGR_mixed_military_ukr_desc:0 "Previously the acceptance of native Ukrainians into the military and police forces of the Reichskommissariat have been kept fairly restricted and regulated. Now the German is seen exclusively as the face of the oppressor, but by increasing the numbers of natives allowed into the garrisons it should go a long way towards easing tensions with the local population whilst also freeing up more Germans for deployment elsewhere."
 GER_SGR_german_divisions_ukr:0 "German Divisions"
 GER_SGR_german_divisions_ukr_desc:0 "The Ukrainian region is still home to native resistance movements, and whilst the idea has been raised of bringing more natives into the local garrisons, several miltarists have argued that this will only lead to corruption and actually strengthen the resistence movements in Ukraine. They simply do not trust that by inviting non-aryans into the garrisons that intelligence and equipment wont be 'misplaced', and demand that more Germans be sent to secure the region."
 GER_SGR_new_native_policy:0 "New Native Policy"
 GER_SGR_new_native_policy_desc:0 "The treatment and living conditions of native Ukrainians in the past has been, to be frank, awful. Koch's zealous adherense to racial theories have led to an actively hostile population consumed by poverty. But now a new regime rules from Germania, and we will issue new guidelines to dictate how the natives must be treated in the region. By improving the conditions of those who inhabit Ukraine alongside us, just maybe we will be able to save it."
 GER_SGR_ukrainian_self_rule:0 "Ukrainian Self-Rule"
 GER_SGR_ukrainian_self_rule_desc:0 "The policies of the past are what doomed the Reich, and it is not missed by anyone that the Reichskommissariats gave little if any help to anybody during the Civil War. Germany must change course, establish real allies and real relationships within Europe. With Ukraine agreeing to work with us, the time has come to dismantle the Reichskommissariat and establish self-rule for the Ukrainians as an independent member of the Pakt."
 GER_SGR_empower_the_party:0 "Empower The Party"
 GER_SGR_empower_the_party_desc:0 "The Arbeitsbereich Osten der NSDAP, the political organization leading Ukraine since it joined the Reich, has always been directed by the wishes and policy of the Party back in Germany. But now that we have established a free pro-German government in Ukraine, the time has come to empower the AOdNSDAP to largely make its own decisions for leading their new country."
 GER_SGR_oversee_elections:0 "Oversee Elections"
 GER_SGR_oversee_elections_desc:0 "With the establishment of a new independent state in the Ukraine, the time has come for them to hold their first set of elections to begin a new chapter in their history. With Ukraine being a new and fragile state, we will make sure to oversee these elections on the behalf of the Ukranian government to ensure that the Ukranian people are able to democratically elect the government we permit them to."
 GER_SGR_a_fair_deal:0 "A Fair Deal"
 GER_SGR_a_fair_deal_desc:0 "While Ukraine existed as a Reichskommissariat within the Reich, we enforced upon them deals highly favorable towards Germany on a number of trade goods, particularly on Ukranian grain shipments. Whilst we may have given Ukraine back to the Ukrainians, our need for these goods has not gone away. As the first big step towards constructing a modern and respectable relationship between our two countries we shall renegotiate these trade deals to ensure both sides can benefit."
 GER_SGR_military_restrictions_ukr:0 "Military Restrictions"
 GER_SGR_military_restrictions_ukr_desc:0 "As per the details of the treaties granting them their independence, the time has come to withdraw German troops from Ukraine. However they are still a member of the Pakt and many within Germany are demanding that military restrictions should be placed upon the new state should this experiment fail and more dangerous elements rise to power within the region. By forcing Ukraine to have only a token military we can ensure that they will never be in a position to deny our will, or retribution."
 GER_SGR_permit_the_zsu:0 "Permit The ZSU"
 GER_SGR_permit_the_zsu_desc:0 "The time has come to withdraw German troops from Ukraine and largely hand the responcibility of protecting and securing their country to themselves. With Ukraine still highly dependent upon us as leader of the Pakt, we have been asked to grant our blessing to the Ukrainians founding their own military, the ZSU. Every free member of the Pakt is expected to contribute towards its defense, and granting Ukraine our blessing will surely allow them to better secure their lands against any lingering resistance."
 GER_SGR_gotenland:0 "Gotenland"
 GER_SGR_gotenland_desc:0 "Back in December of 1941, the late Führer Adolf Hitler expressed his dream that one day Southern Ukraine would be a mighty German colony which would become the district of Gotenland within the Reich. Resulting policies have ensured that German colonization has been focused in the area and the undesirable native Ukranians removed. In order to protect the German population of the region, we shall make the late Führer's dream a reality and split the former Reichskommissariat to keep Gotenland under proper German rule."
