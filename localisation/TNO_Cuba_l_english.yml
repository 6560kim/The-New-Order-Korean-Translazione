  POLITICS_FIDEL_CASTRO_DESC:0 "The Americans needed a man in Cuba to stop Germany getting theirs instead. That man, was Fidel Castro. A socialist revolutionary might not seem like the most likely of allies for the United States, but they could not be picky if they did not want a Nazi puppet on their doorstep. Castro is therefore the perfect counter to this problem, as he despises fascism more than they do. He is a rather difficult yet brave man, determined to make Cuba into a socialist paradise for the people of the island. He is confident that his country can become a self-sustaining, modern and progressive nation that will shine as a beacon of socialism.\n\nCastro is simultaneously quite loyal to his benefactors, the CIA. This perhaps intensely confusing state of affairs does have some logic behind it on Castro's part. Cooperation has allowed to him to govern Cuba mostly as he pleases without having to concern himself too much with American interests. It was after all with American aid that he overthrew Fulgencio Batista, the previous ruler of the island. This did come at a cost however. US shell companies are allowed to operate in Cuba as per the agreement that put Castro in power. Understandably, this has harmed his relationship with many of his fellow revolutionaries, who view this arrangement with a foreign power as severe betrayal of socialist ideals. Castro is however steadfast in his belief that he is taking the country down the right path and that by keeping the United States close, he is inadvertently keeping them off Cuba's back. He sees the alliance as something necessary, as means to create the classless society he desires for Cuba. Although popular, his chosen methods to achieve communism has left him walking a tightrope between the anti-US socialists and the Americans themselves."
